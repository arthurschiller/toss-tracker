A project for the VisionHack Hackathon

Toss Tracker is a gamified companion app for jugglers that automatically tracks your catches.
Learning to juggle offers a wide range of benefits. It’s not only simply a fun skill but amongst others improves hand-eye coordination, balance, posture, endurance, concentration and releases stress. I’ve started to jungle during the pandemic in 2021 and do it a lot in-between long long coding sessions to regain focus. It requires a lot of practice, especially as a beginner to get started. Toss Tracker can help people learn to juggle while actively showing them their progress.
